\textit{aka} 'The Flip bit attack III'

\textbf{Paper's sum-up:}

This paper is extended the work of Boneh and Boa 'Flipped bit attack I \& II' the following way.
Fisrt is recalled the previous attacks, then they propose an extension to LUC
\footnote{LUC is a public-key cryptosystem developed by a group of researchers in Australia and New
Zealand. The cipher implements the analogs of ElGamal -LUCELG-, Diffie-Hellman -LUCDIF-, and RSA 
-LUCRSA- over Lucas sequences.} cryptosystem, KMOV cryptosystem and finally give minors improovment.
\footnote{KMOV is an elliptic curve based analogue to RSA}
