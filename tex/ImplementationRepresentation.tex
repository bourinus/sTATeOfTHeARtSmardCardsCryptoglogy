\subsection{Number representations}
\label{RSA_representation}

This section will be mainly dedicated to the different ways to represent 
numbers \textit{i.e.} integers or relative numbers. Plan id the following:
\begin{itemize}
	\item  Classical $b$-arry representations
	\item  Some binary representations
	\item  Non adjacent representations
\end{itemize}
AIM: Change the representation of a an integers or relative numbers for a new one.
What will be obtained might be a less simple, or might requires  more amount of digits but will be but richer in term of algebraic/computational proprieties(s).\\

\noindent
	\begin{mydef}{Canonical vs Non-Canonical representation}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item 'canonical' is used to indicate a standard way to represent a 
			mathematical object under the form of a mathematical expression.
    		This a particular convention that was accepted as standard among 
    		an important number of possible conventions. 
			\item 'non-canonical' by opposition means that the convention used to 
			to represent a mathematical object under the form of a mathematical 
			expression is not he standard one, therefore this expression is 
			meaningless unless convention to which it is referring is specified.
		\end{itemize}
    \end{mydef}		

Example:\\
In geometry, the canonical way to represent objects is referring to a Cartesian 
coordinate system system and no-one wonder what type of mathematical object 
represent the following expression $(x-h)^2+(y-k)^2= \rho^2$, 
(circle centered on $(h,k)$ and of radius $|\rho|$).

\subsubsection{Mathematical notation}
Two way to interpret Euclidean division: \\

\begin{mydef}{Euclidean division:} \\
	Given $a,b $ positive integers there exist a unique couple of integers $ (q,r)$ \\
	such that decompose uniquely $a$ in the famous Euclidean form.\\
	\textit{i.e.} Given $a,b \in \mathbb{N}$ $\exists! (q,r) \in \mathbb{N}^2$, such that:
	\begin{center}
			$a = b \times q + r$ with $0\leq r <b$\\
	\end{center}
\end{mydef}		 
		As a consequence each number, can be decomposed the following way:\\
		$n = 2^k \times b  + r$ with $0 \leq r <2^{k-1}$. \\
		$n = 2^k \times b + r$ with $-2^{k-1}<r \leq 2^{k-1}$ \\\\
		The first equality is the canonical one, it allows representation in any $b$-basis with positive digits, whereas the second one, not canonical, enable representations in any binary basis with positive and negative digits but with 
		smaller absolute values -Useful for ECC, RSA with NAF exponent-.\\\\
		Iterating the division process on $a$ from the highest power of $b$ to 0, a link is naturally created between polynomial in $b$ and representation in basis $b$.\\\\
\textbf{Possible properties of $b$-basis representations}\\
* position relativity: representation in which the localization of a digit matters\\
* completeness for $\mathbb{S}$: each element of a set of number $\mathbb{S}$ can be represented\\
* uniqueness for $\mathbb{S}$: each element of $\mathbb{S}$ admits only one representative.\\
* homogeneity: representation in which all operations are performed in the same way.\\
* optimality: representation in which a propriety is minimized -Length, Hamming weight, many others-
among a larger family of representation.

Remarks:\\
* For positional representation system:
the basis is always written the same manner, $10$, consequence of link between $b$-arry representation/polynomial expansion of variable $b$:\\
$ 10 = 10_{10} $, $ 2 = 10_{2} $, $ b = 10_{b} $, $ -b = 10_{-b} $ \\
* Interesting properties are the span and shape of $\mathbb{S}$:\\
is this including negative number? is this a perfect, quite, strongly not, symmetrical span?\\
* In the following section, we always have $a \in \mathbb{S}$

Notation: \\
* $b \in \mathbb{N}^*$, basis will be $b$ or $-b$ \\
* $ \mathcal{D} $ is the digit space.\\
* $t$ number of bits of the considered architecture

\subsubsection{Classical $b$-arry representations}
Here are approached some classical general representations.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Unary notation: representation with $b=1$, \textit{aka} 'Peano Unary system'.\\
		Simplest way to represent integers numbers...\\
		For that representation to include $0$ we impose digit space to admits two elements\\
		$/!\backslash$ Formal -but non consistent with the general one- scripture
		\begin{small}
			\begin{center}	
		$ a_{1} = \sum \limits_{i=0}^{t-1} a_i$ and $\forall i, a_i \in \mathcal{D} =\{0,1\}$ 	
			\end{center}
		\end{small}
		* completeness for $\mathbb{S} = \llbracket 0, t \rrbracket$ \\
		* no uniqueness neither a positional system\\
		* the value 0 can only be implicitly represented by an empty digit string\\
		* addition is in fact concatenation, homogeneous\\
		
	\item $b$-arry notation: general canonical representation in base $b$, for $b \in \mathbb{N} \backslash \{0,1\} $ :\\	
		starting from the least significant digit, number is obtained via a polynomial in $b$ which coefficients are the digits of the number representative.
		\begin{small}
			\begin{center}	
				$ a_{b} = \sum \limits_{i=0}^{t-1} a_i \times b^i$ 
				and $\forall i, a_i \in	\mathcal{D} = \{0, ..., b-1\}$		
			\end{center}
		\end{small}	
		% A = (b-1) * sum b^i,i=0,t-1 = (b-1) * B, and 
		% B = (b^t-1)/(b-1)
		* unique representation for $\mathbb{S} =\llbracket 0, b^{t}-1\rrbracket$\\
		* homogeneity

	\item Signed $b$-arry notation: representation in base $b \in \mathbb{N} \backslash \{0,1\} $, \textit{aka} 'Sign and Magnitude  in base $b$'
		\begin{small}
			\begin{center}	
					$ a_{b,signed} = a_t \sum \limits_{i=0}^{t-1} a_i \times b^i$ and $\forall i, 
					a_i \in \mathcal{D} = \{0, ..., b-1\}$ 		
			\end{center}
		\end{small}	
		% from previous one
		* completeness for  $\mathbb{S}=\llbracket 1-b^{t-1}, b^{t-1}-1\rrbracket$ \\
		* non unique representation + 0 and -0\\
		* non homogeneous system ! \\
		* Simple to implement \\  
		* Symmetrical span
			
	\item Nega $b$-arry notation: canonical representation in base $-b$ 
		for $b \in \mathbb{N} \backslash \{0,1\} $ : 
		\begin{small}
			\begin{center}	
					$ a_{-b} = \sum \limits_{i=0}^{t-1} a_i \times (-b)^i$ 
					and $\forall i, a_i \in \mathcal{D}=\{0, .., b-1\}$ 		
			\end{center}
		\end{small}	
		% AM = (b-1) * sum (-b)^i, i=0,t-1   and i \in 2N = (b-1) * BM
		% BM = 		   sum (-b)^i, i=0,t-2   and i \in 2N
		% BM = 		   sum   b^(2i), i=0, t/2-1 = (b^t-1)/(b^2-1)
		% AM = (b-1) * (b^t-1)/(b^2-1)
		%
		% Bm =         sum (-b)^i, i=0,t-1   and i \in 2N+1
		% Bm = 		   sum (-b)^i, i=1,t-1   and i \in 2N+1
		% Bm =    -b * sum b^(2i), i=0, t/2-1
		% Am =    -b * (b-1) * (b^t-1)(b^2-1)
		%
		%$ -b \frac{b^t-1}{b+1}, \frac{b^t-1}{b+1}$	
		* completeness for a $\mathbb{S} = \llbracket -b \frac{b^t-1}{b+1}, \frac{b^t-1}{b+1}\rrbracket $ \\
		* completeness for $\mathbb{S}$ without bit sign ! \\
		* uniqueness for $\mathbb{S}$ \\
		* although arithmetic operations are more complicated, homogeneity of operations ! \\
		* $/!\backslash \hspace{1mm} \mathbb{S}$ not centered on 0, strongly asymmetrical span $\hspace{1mm} /!\backslash$

	\item  One's complement in base $b$ 
		\begin{small}
			\begin{center}	
					$ a_{b,1*} = (b^{t}-1)_b-a_b$ 
					% a = (b^t-1) - a_{b,1*}	
			\end{center}
		\end{small}	
		* except MSB, each bit is a power of $b$
	\item  Two's complement in base $b$ 
		\begin{small}
			\begin{center}	
					$ a_{b,2*} = b^{t}_b-a_b$ 				
					% a = b^t - a_{b,2*}
			\end{center}
		\end{small}	
		* except MSB, each bit is a power of $b$, except for the most significant bit,\\
		whose weight is the negative of the corresponding power of $b$.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Some binary representations}
	\begin{itemize}	
		\item  Binary notation: canonical representation base 2:
		\begin{small}
			\begin{center}	
					$  a_{2}  =  \sum \limits_{i=0}^{t-1} a_i \times 2^i$ 
					and $\forall i, a_i \in \mathcal{D}= \{0,1\}$		
			\end{center}
		\end{small}	
			* Homogeneity\\
			* Complete for $\mathbb{N}$\\
			* Uniqueness for $\mathbb{N}$\\

		\item Signed binary: canonical representation in base $2$, \textit{aka} 'Sign and Magnitude in base $2$':
		\begin{small}
			\begin{center}	
					$  a_{2, signed} = {-1}^{a_{t-1}} \sum \limits_{i=0}^{t-2} a_i \times (2)^i$ 
					and $\forall i, a_i \in \mathcal{D}=\{ 0, 1\}$ 		
			\end{center}
		\end{small}
 		+ Simple to implement. \\ 
		+ Useful for floating point representation.  \\  
		- Sign bit independent of magnitude \\ 
		- can be  both + 0 and -0  (Makes math hard to do). \\  
		
		\item  One's complement canonical representation	
			\begin{center}	
				\begin{small}	
					$ a_{1*} = (2^{t}-1)_2-a_2 =\overline{ a_{2} }$,			
				\end{small}	
			\end{center}
			Except the MSB, each bit is a power of $2$\\
			The MSB is seen as the negative of $(2^{t}-1)$.\\
			And with a written as $ a_{1*} = \{a_{t-1}, a_{t-2}, ..., a_{1}, a_{0}  \} $ 
			\begin{center}	
				\begin{small}	
					% a = (b^t-1) - a_{b,1*}	

					$ a = - a_{t-1} (2^{t}-1) + \sum \limits_{i=0}^{t-2} a_i 2^{i}$
				\end{small}	
			\end{center}
			* completeness for $\mathbb{S}=\llbracket 1-b^{t-1}, b^{t-1}-1 \rrbracket$ \\
			* non uniqueness: two zeros $a_i=0$ and $a_i=1$\\
			* Feature: +0 and -0 return TRUE when tested for zero, FALSE when tested for non-zero. 

		\item  Two's complement canonical representation
			\begin{center}	
			If $a \geq 0$:
				\begin{small}	
					$ a_{2*} = a_2 $
				\end{small}	
			If $a \leq 0$:				
				\begin{small}	
					$ a_{2*} = 2^{t}_2-a_2 = \overline{ a_{2_{Signed}} }+1 $
				\end{small}					
			\end{center}
			Except the MSB, each bit is a power of $2$\\
			The MSB is seen as the negative of the corresponding power of $2$.\\
			And with a written as $ a_{2*} = \{a_{t-1}, a_{t-2}, ..., a_{1}, a_{0}  \} $ 
			\begin{center}	
				\begin{small}	
					$ a = - a_{t-1} 2^{t} + \sum \limits_{i=0}^{t-2} a_i 2^{i}$
				\end{small}	
			\end{center}
			* completeness for $\mathbb{S}=\llbracket -b^{t-1}, b^{t-1}-1 \rrbracket$ \\
			* homogeneity \\
			* there is one zero only. \\
			* multiplying 2's complement operands takes just about same amount of hardware as multiplying unsigned operand\\

		\item Nega binary: canonical representation in base $-2$: \\ 
		\begin{small}
			\begin{center}	
					$  a_{-2} =  \sum \limits_{i=0}^{t-1} a_i \times (-2)^i$ 
					and $\forall i, a_i \in \mathcal{D}=\{-1, 0\}$ 		
			\end{center}
		\end{small}
			* completeness for $\mathbb{S} \subset  \mathbb{Z} $ \\
			* $/!\backslash \mathbb{S}$ not centered on 0, strongly asymmetrical span$/!\backslash$
			* basic routines requires some efforts.\\

	\item Binary Signed Digit representation:\\
			Here is relaxed on condition on the digit of the representation, leading to non canonical representation.
			Here they have value in $\{-1, 0 , 1\}$, but the formal decomposition remain the same:
			\begin{center}
				\begin{small}
							$ a_{-1, 0 , 1} = \sum \limits_{i=0}^{t-1} a_i \times 2^i$  with $a_i \in \mathcal{D} =\{ -1,0,1\}$ \\
				\end{small}
			\end{center}
			The consequence it that number are not uniquely decompose: 	this is not canonical. 	\\
			On the other hand this additional degree of liberty allow to choose between	decompositions available.	

	\item Canonical Binary Signed Digit representation: \textit{aka} 'Binary-NAF'\\
			And precisely, without ambiguity, its name is '2-width Binary NAF'
\footnote{the width refers to the number among which only one will be allowed to be a non zero.}\\
			Here is relaxed on condition on the digit of the representation, leading to non canonical representation.
			Here they have value in $\{-1, 0 , 1\}$, but if the formal decomposition remain the same, one additional condition
			namely 'no adjacent 1' lead to one representation.
			\begin{center}
				\begin{small}
					$ a_{2-NAF} = \sum \limits_{i=0}^{t-1} a_i \times 2^i$  with $a_i \in \mathcal{D} =\{ -1,0,1\}$ \\
		    	 $\forall i \in \llbracket 0,t-1 \rrbracket,   a_i \times a_{i+1} =0$
				\end{small}			
			\end{center}	

		\item Binary Alternating Greedy expansion	
		this is a signed binary expansion, with the property that consecutive
		non zero digit -even if separated by some 0- are opposed.
		useful in several left-to-right algorihms

		\item Zeckendorf representation:\\
		A number can be decomposed in a unique way as a sum of Fibonnaci numbers,
		in which there is no two consecutive Fibonnaci number used.
		%* x^{F_n} can be computed with one initial squarring and only multiplication\\
		There exist a signed digit Zeckendorf representation.\\

\subsection{Group representations}

\subsubsection{Chinese Theorem of Remainders:}
Elements of some finite fields $ \mathbb{Z}/{n \mathbb{Z}} $, 
where $n$ is a product of primes
\begin{itemize}
	\item Canonical representation in $ \mathbb{Z}/{n \mathbb{Z}} $,\\
	4 times slower tan CRT to achieve an RSA exponentiation.	
	
	\item Uses of Chinese theorem of remainders, 
	smaller number fastening the computations.
	Require a recombination step: Gauss, Garner, ...

	\noindent
	\textit{VS side channel cryptanalysis}\\
Because of the recombination step, that can be side channel analysed or even
perturbed, the CRT implementation bring also some potential weaknesses.
