\subsubsection{Physical threat: fault injection}

THE reference: 
\cite{book-2012-joye}, published in 2012, countains more than 400 bibliographical references


Due to the mathematical complexity of some laser attack, 
which a complete description would force me to do a lot of 'recall' 
about abstract maths and would dramatically increase the size of 
this document, the goal for this part are:
\begin{center}
1 - list the known papers, sum-up practical content.\\
2 - evaluate their efficiency in term of bit(s) per fault.\\
3 - evaluate their feasibility in term of countermeasures.\\
\end{center}

Two remarks, as stupids than fundamental:
\begin{center}
	All attacks by fault injection, assume a \textit{fault model}.\\
	\textbf{
	The more unprecise the model is the more realistic the attack.\\
	Many of the fault model are 'impossible' to check.
}
\end{center}

\subsection*{FI targetting CRT-optimized RSA:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Coron - \cite{ches-2009-coron}

\underline{Type of attack:}\\
reproducible input\\
partially known plain-text \\
RtoL exponentiation algorithm only\\
\underline{Result:}\\
CRT: one faulty encryption is enough\\
non CRT: several faulty encryption are required.\\
\underline{Fault localisation}:\\
CRT:\\
non CRT: one of the two CRT exponentiation\\
\underline{Relying on}:\\
Recent improvement of Coppersmith's algorithm to find small 
roots of multivariate polynomial.

Electro magnetic fault injection are the most powerful... wtf
