\subsubsection{Physical threat: side channel}


$M/M^2$ attack
zero attacks (not working with CRT)
doubling attack
novack attack
Note: There is no logic in the order in which the different attacks are listed !


Most of the time in smart card evaluation only known plain-text attack can be performed
