			\noindent
			This method is simply applying the definition of the exponentiation 
			as a set of exponentiation to obtained the desired result. 
	
			Enjoy: some academic paper from 1986 has been found considering that this algorithm 
			was competitive.

			This method will always return the worst of all exponentiation chains:  $\{1, \; ... ,\;n \}$ which length $l(n)$ is $n$.	To compute $x^n$, $n$ successives power of $x$ are computed !
