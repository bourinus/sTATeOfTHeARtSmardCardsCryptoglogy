\textit{aka} apper countaining the 'flip bit attack'

\underline{Around the attack:}
The attack presented by Sciventure is in fact the second one much more 
realistic in its fault model. One of the very first paper on the subject.

\textbf{Paper's sum-up:}
Attack the RSA algorithm in its straightforward version, the ElGamal signature
scheme, the Schnorr signature scheme, and the DSA. 
RSA is attacked in two different ways: the first attack aim to flip on bit of the
message, the other one aiming to flip on bit of the exponent.

\underline{Fault model:}
Unrealistic: the first fault model - precisely flip one bit  in $m^{2^i}$ -
appears to be completely unaplicable. Certainly that to flip one bit of an 
exponent is an (difficult but) achievable objective ...

\underline{Type of attack:}\\
randomly chosen $\&$ reproducible plain-text attack\\

\underline{Target:} S \& M algorithm in LtoR and RtoL version.

\underline{Counter measure}
Nothing said bout that, because the authors give 
their own counter measure to their attack.\\

\textbf{Summing up \textit{ Attacking the RSA Scheme}}
 \textit{'flip bit attack II'}

\textbf{Notation:} let $m$ be the plain-text, $c$ the cyphertext and $t$ and
their number of bits, with this, the authors define, which allow them to 
write the cypher text as a product:
\begin{center}
$\forall i \in [0,t-1]$ $m_i = {m^2}^i \mod n$\\
$c ={c_{t-1}}^{d_{t-1}}...{c_i}^{d_i}...{c_1}^{d_1}{c_0}^{d_0} \mod n$
\end{center}
\textbf{Attack I:}
the message has been faulted, with a single bit flip:
\begin{center}
$c' ={c_{t-1}}^{d_{t-1}}...{c'_i}^{d_i}...{c_1}^{d_1}{c_0}^{d_0} \mod n$
\end{center}
Then 
$ \frac{c'}{c} = \frac{{c'_i}^{d_i}}{{c_i}^{d_i}} $ can be evaluated, 
on the other hand can be also calculated the $t^2$ possible values,
if a match is found then $i$ is known, $d_i=1$.\\
\underline{Limitation}\\
* only one $m_i$ contain one bit of error \\
* no propagation of error is tolerated, if $m$ is modified, all $m_i$ are\\

\textbf{Attack II:}
Approximately the same faulting only one bit of the exponent.

\underline{Limitation}\\
* only one $d_i$ contain one bit of error \\
